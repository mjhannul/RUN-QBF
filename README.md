# RUN-QBF

This repository contains a Tensorflow implementation of an unsupervised recurrent neural network for the quantified Boolean formula problem (RUN-QBF). 

The network architecture extends that of RUN-CSP, introduced [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.08387) for constraint satisfaction problems. The project code is likewise modified and expanded from the [source code](https://github.com/RUNCSP/RUN-CSP) behind RUN-CSP.

This project is currently in progress. The model is up and running but needs tuning and re-training.

The subdirectory 'data' contains zipped files for both training and evaluation data. The evaluation data in particular consists of the instances in the Prenex 2QBF Track of the [QBFEVAL'18](http://www.qbflib.org/event_page.php?year=2018) competition. The subdirectory 'models' contains two models: one for the Pi2 and another for the Sigma1 level. To extract the data files:

```
cd data
unzip '*.zip'
cd ..
```

Train your own models by using the given training scripts. The following commands were used to train the Sigma1 and Pi2 models, respectively:

```
python3 train.py -d data/2QBF-train/Sigma1 -m models/Sigma1
python3 train.py -d data/2QBF-train/Pi2 -m models/Pi2 models/Sigma1 -b 1 -c 0 400 -e 4
```

Evaluate the Pi2 model using the command:

```
python3 evaluate.py -d data/2QBF-eval/Pi2 -m models/Pi2 models/Sigma1
```
